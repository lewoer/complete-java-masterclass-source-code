The following code snippet opens a file for both reading and writing by using one of the newByteChannel methods.
The SeekableByteChannel that is returned is cast to a FileChannel.
 Then, 12 bytes are read from the beginning of the file, and the string "I was here!" is written at that location.
  The current position in the file is moved to the end, and the 12 bytes from the beginning are appended.
  Finally, the string, "I was here!" is appended, and the channel on the file is closed.
